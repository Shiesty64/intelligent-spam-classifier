# intelligent-spam-classifier

## Project Overview

This project develops a functional intelligent system that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to classify incoming messages as either "Ham" (legitimate) or "Spam" (unsolicited/malicious). It serves as a practical demonstration of supervised machine learning principles, natural language processing (NLP) for text handling, and proficiency in Python programming.

The goal is to automate the crucial task of filtering unwanted and potentially dangerous messages, thereby improving user experience and enhancing digital security.

## Features

*   **Spam/Ham Classification:** Accurately categorizes messages into "ham" or "spam."
*   **Text Preprocessing:** Cleans and normalizes raw text data (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stop word removal, stemming).
*   **TF-IDF Feature Extraction:** Converts processed text into numerical features, giving more weight to important and rare words.
*   **Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, known for its effectiveness in text classification.
*   **Model Evaluation:** Provides comprehensive performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix.
*   **New Message Prediction:** Demonstrates real-time classification of custom, unseen messages.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally and run the classifier.

### Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.x:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
